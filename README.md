# PomBase curation

This repository stores data and other files for PomBase.

The `data_files` directory has tab-delimited text files used to
populate web pages in the "Status" section of www.pombase.org.

Otherwise, this repo is essentially a placeholder.  We will move the
(currently private) pombe-embl Subversion repo here soon.
