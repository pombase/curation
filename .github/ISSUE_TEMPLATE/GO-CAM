Checklist

Terms included in pathway 

Add network overview and sources

Pathway link


- [ ] Check inputs and outputs
- [ ] Check that processes are consistent
- [ ] Check that componets are aligned (and transporters included where compartment change
- [ ] Check that all terms are evidenced and equivalent to PomBase
- [ ] Metabolic- Add key chemicals (especially inputs, outputs and branchpoints)
      (do not need to add all chemicals as we should be able to automate eventually)
      (do not need to add currency chemicals)
- [ ] Check PomBase for spurious annotations (remove or challenge external)
- [ ] At the end do a 'diff' for any annotated componets that are not included in the pathway
- [ ] Metabolic- add vitamins and cofactors and link to cofactor biosynthesis pathways
