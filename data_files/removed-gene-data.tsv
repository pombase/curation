Removed gene	Comment	Reference	Date
SPBC19G7.12c	removed because sequence similarity supports SPBC19G7.11c		2004-09-14
SPAC212.10	removed as part of UTR of SPAC212.11		
SPAC3F10.14	reverse strand of SPAC3F10.15c		
SPBC428.09c	presumed non-coding as no methionine or consensus splice sites		
SPAC222.17c	presumed non-coding; was a very small ORF in ncRNA prl50		
SPNCRNA.135	Initially annotated as a non-coding RNA but subsequently determined to be the 5' UTR of SPBC16D10.06	pers. comm S. Whitehall	
SPBPB21E7.10	partial ORF of 35 aa, no reason to believe this is coding		
SPAC4G8.15c	dubious; unsupported by Solexa transcript data		
SPAPB18E9.03c	dubious; unsupported by Solexa transcript data		
SPBC18H10.21c	alias SPBC9B6.01c; dubious; unsupported by Solexa transcript data		
SPBC9B6.01c	alias of SPBC18H10.21c; dubious; unsupported by Solexa transcript data		
SPCC2H8.03	dubious; unsupported by Solexa transcript data		
SPAC22E12.12	dubious; unsupported by Solexa transcript data		
SPNCRNA.85	replaced by protein coding gene SPAC227.19c		
SPNCRNA.48	replaced by protein coding gene SPAC2F3.18		
SPNCRNA.97	replaced by short protein coding gene SPAC27E2.14		
SPAC8E11.09c	previously annotated as dubious but no evidence for splicing, and non-canonical splice sites; unsupported by Solexa transcript data		
SPAC22E12.15	previously annotated as dubious but dubious splice prediction; unsupported by Solexa transcript data		
SPAC1002.21	was annotated as dubious but based on position in uracil regulatable operon, as this CDS does not appear to be transcribed. t is possible that the localization data is an artifact of the combination of overexpression and hydrophobicity. The protein sequence is also a strange composition, and there is no ortholog in octosporus or japonicus genomes. On balance, taking into account all of the available features and contextual information, it is unlikely that this feature codes for a bona fide protein.
